# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the “Important Information” disclaimer block from the Australian Visa Status Check page.

**Planned changes:**
- Delete the “Important Information” card/section from the Australian Visa Status Check screen UI so it is no longer rendered.
- Ensure none of the disclaimer strings (“Important Information” and the listed bullet lines) appear anywhere in the rendered page content.
- Keep all existing page behavior unchanged (form submission, results display, reset behavior).

**User-visible outcome:** The Australian Visa Status Check page no longer shows the “Important Information” disclaimer content, while all visa check interactions work as before.
