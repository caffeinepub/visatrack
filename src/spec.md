# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign the visa check page to match the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs website style.

**Planned changes:**
- Add dark navy blue header (#002554) with Australian Government coat of arms logo, Department of Home Affairs text, hamburger menu, and search icon
- Add navigation links below header: ImmiAccount, Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO), and My Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS)
- Add breadcrumb navigation: Home > Visas > When you have a visa
- Change main content area to bright blue background (#006CB5) with large white heading "Check visa details and conditions"
- Add expandable "Check conditions online (VEVO)" section with dropdown arrow
- Maintain existing reference number and email input fields with check functionality

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a professional government-style interface that matches the Australian Department of Home Affairs website design while retaining the ability to check visa application status using reference number and email.
