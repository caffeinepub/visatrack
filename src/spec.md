# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the PDF column from the application status display interface.

**Planned changes:**
- Hide the PDF attachment column from the ApplicationStatusManager component
- Remove PDF-related UI elements from the application status table/list
- Preserve backend PDF storage functionality

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a cleaner application status interface without the PDF column, while PDF data continues to be stored in the backend.
