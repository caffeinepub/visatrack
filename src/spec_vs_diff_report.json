  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to ApplicationStatusManager and AustralianVisaCheckPage components. Both files are truncated, making complete verification impossible. Based on visible evidence, the components appear to handle application status display without rendering PDF-related UI elements, but the truncation prevents full confirmation of all acceptance criteria.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Verify that PDF data continues to be stored in the backend when creating/editing status entries",
      "reason": "The diff shows frontend components only. The constraint explicitly states 'Do not modify backend PDF storage logic,' but the truncated ApplicationStatusManager.tsx shows a createOrUpdateMutation without visible evidence that PDF storage backend functionality remains intact. Cannot verify backend preservation from frontend-only changes.",
