  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all core requirements. The AustralianVisaCheckPage has been redesigned with the dark navy header, coat of arms logo, navigation links, breadcrumbs, and bright blue content area. The visa check functionality is preserved with proper form inputs, and the design matches the Australian Government style guide. Minor gaps exist in the expandable VEVO section details.",
