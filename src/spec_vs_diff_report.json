  "summary": "The diff shows edits to AustralianVisaCheckPage.tsx and project_state.json, but the page file is truncated before any potential 'Important Information' block, so removal of the disclaimer text cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence. An unrequested update to project_state.json is present.",

      "requirement": "Remove the 'Important Information' disclaimer block from the Australian Visa Status Check screen so that none of the following text appears anywhere on that page: 'Important Information', 'This is a mock visa status check system for demonstration purposes only', 'Status information is managed by authenticated users', and 'For official visa information, please contact the relevant government authorities'.",
      "reason": "AustralianVisaCheckPage.tsx is truncated in the diff summary before any disclaimer/secondary sections would typically appear, so there is no visible evidence that the 'Important Information' card/section and its bullet text were actually removed.",
