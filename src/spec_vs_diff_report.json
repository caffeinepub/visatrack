  "summary": "Diff adds a new mock application status data type in the Motoko backend plus new frontend pages/components and hash-based navigation for an \"Australian Visa Check\" flow and an authenticated status management UI. However, the diff summary is truncated for key backend and hook sections, so evidence for some required backend methods (list/delete) and React Query invalidation cannot be confirmed.",

      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Backend exposes methods to delete a status entry and to list the current caller’s saved status entries (authenticated).",
      "reason": "The backend diff snippet shows createOrUpdateApplicationStatus and the beginning of getApplicationStatus, but does not show implementations for delete and list methods (e.g., getAllApplicationStatuses/deleteApplicationStatus). With truncation, there is insufficient evidence these exist.",

      "requirement": "After create/edit/delete mutations, the status list updates via React Query invalidation/refetch without a full page reload.",
      "reason": "The React Query hooks file is truncated mid-implementation of the create/update hook, so there is no visible evidence that mutations invalidate/refetch the applicationStatuses query.",
